				<h2>My Life in a Brief Overview</h1>
					<div class="column1of3">
						<h3>My Family and Background</h3>
						<p>I am from a very diverse background. Normally people cannot guess where I am from and I am proud of that. My mother is from Trinidad and my father is from Romania. My roots are unique, and I believe that adds to my overall character and my diversity as a person.
						</p>

					<div class="column2of3">
						<h3>Achievements</h3>
						<p>Throughout my high school career I have worked hard for everything I have accomplished. Freshman year I was put in the lowest classes in my school. Quickly I realized that the course work was not challenging enough. As I went through each grade level I got into harder classes, worked harder, to obtain the same averages that I had in lower classes. By the end of my high school career I will take 5 AP courses. This is striking to me, since I never thought I would make it this far. Overall, I am extremely proud of myself and will continue to work hard in everything I do.

						<h3>Aspirations</h3>
						<p>As of right now I am not particularly sure what I want to do with my life. I am not sure anyone really is at my age. However, the most important thing is that I become a role model for women. I want to be a role model for women, so  I can inspire them to pursue their passion no matter what anyone says. Regardless of what my occupation is in the future, I know that I will be empowering other women to pursue what they want and to believe in their full potential.
